## Forgetful Beacon
---

Forgetful Beacon helps locate people with dissociative amnesia, while safeguarding personal information. Facial recognition is used to identify a person and send an alert to their emergency contact.

### Objective

The objective is to help people with dissociative amnesia to be reunited with their family/caregivers if they get lost during a dissociative episode, while safeguarding their personal data from strangers. To do this, the program uses facial recognition to identify the user and sends an alert to their emergency contact(s), who will receive the picture, to corroborate the identity of the lost person, and the location of where they were found.

### How we built it

The main idea was to develop an app that could identify a lost person given a database with their facial characteristics, name, location, contacts, age and health problems. A samaritan would take a photo to a QR code paste on the lost person that is linked to our app and will require to take a facial's photo that will send it to a given server with an facial recognition algorithm linked to the database and alert to the relative partners of the lost person.
